1. Gather your materials:
	1. A feather microcontroller board (M0 or M4 work best)
	2. A GPS FeatherWing
	3. A Feather doubler
	4. An active antenna (optional)
	5. An Adalogger FeatherWing & an SD card (also optional). If you use this, you will need a feather tripler instead of a feather doubler.

2. Assemble materials:
	1. Put both the feather and the GPS on the feather doubler
	2. Attach the antenna to the GPS FeatherWing

3. Put code (datalogger.py) on the feather

4. Boot the feather in write mode (only applicable if you aren't using an adalogger.
	5. Use the code in boot.py to do it, and connect pin 4 to ground when booting to boot in write mode.

5. Collect data
	1. It should collect the data automatically. Connect to the serial console to verify that data is being collected.

6. Get data.
	1. If you are using an adalogger:
		1. Connect to a serial console.
		2. Make the script stop running with CTRL+C
		3. Exit the serial console
		4. Power down the board by ejecting it and disconnecting the power supply.
		5. Plug the SD card into your computer and copy the file across

	2. If you are using built in storage:
		1. Connect to a serial console.
		2. Stop the script with CTRL+C
		3. Exit the serial console
		4. Copy the file from the board to your computer using terminal or a graphical file manager.
